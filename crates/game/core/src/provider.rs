//! Provider types for action generation.
//!
//! While provider implementations live in the runtime crate, the provider KIND
//! is stored in game state to enable deterministic re-execution during optimistic
//! challenge verification.
//!
//! # Design Rationale
//!
//! In an optimistic rollup with challenge games, we need to prove:
//! > "Given this state and this provider, this action would be generated"
//!
//! To enable this verification, the provider kind must be part of the canonical
//! game state, not just runtime orchestration metadata.
//!
//! # Challenge Game Flow
//!
//! 1. **Optimistic execution**: Runtime uses provider to generate actions, submits proof
//! 2. **Challenge**: Someone disputes that the action came from the declared provider
//! 3. **Resolution**: zkVM re-executes the provider deterministically and proves expected action
//! 4. **Fraud detection**: If expected ≠ submitted, slash malicious player
